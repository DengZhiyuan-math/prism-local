# prism-local

A local, Overleaf/Prism-style studio for LaTeX projects on your own machine:

- **Editor**: CodeMirror 5 with tabs, LaTeX highlighting and search. It autocompletes
  `\cref{…}`/`\eqref{…}` from your labels, `\cite{…}` from your `.bib` files, and `\…` from your
  own `\newcommand`s.
- **Compile and see errors**: one click (⌘↵) builds the project. Errors and warnings
  (undefined references and citations included) are listed with their source lines, and a click
  jumps to the line.
- **PDF preview with SyncTeX**: the preview reloads after every build and keeps its scroll position.
  Double-click the PDF to jump to the source; ⌘J jumps from the source to the PDF. The PDF can
  **pop out into its own tab** and stays in sync there.
- **✦ Agent panel**: an AI agent that edits your project. Pick who runs it: your local
  [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or
  [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) CLI, or an API model with a key: DeepSeek, OpenAI,
  OpenRouter, Qwen, Kimi, or a local Ollama/vLLM. Every turn ends with a per-file diff and
  **Undo this turn**. With Claude Code the panel also shows your remaining 5-hour and 7-day
  usage limits.
- **Home page**: all your projects in one place, with PDF thumbnails, titles, git state and
  which ones are open. Create a project from a template, add an existing folder, pin, rename
  or open any project in one click. The ⌂ button in the editor brings you back.
- **Autosave**: edits are saved a moment after you stop typing, as in Overleaf. There is no
  Save button. Auto-compile (in the Compile menu) builds shortly after that.
- **Works with other tools**: files changed on disk (by Claude Code in a terminal, `git
  checkout`, another editor) reload automatically. A save never silently overwrites a newer
  version on disk.

It is a single Python process that uses only the standard library, listens on `127.0.0.1`, and
needs nothing from npm. The front-end libraries are vendored, so it also works offline.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.9 (tested with 3.11)
- A LaTeX build tool:
  - [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/), used by default if it is on `PATH`, or
  - `latexmk` with a TeX distribution, used if Tectonic is not found. latexmk is a Perl
    script. On Windows, where Perl is rarely on `PATH` (MiKTeX does not ship it), builds use
    the Perl that comes with Git for Windows if no other is found. Otherwise install
    [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com). Or
  - any command you configure in `prism.json`.
- Optional: `git`, for the file status markers and the Diff view.
- Optional, for the agent panel, one of:
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), logged in (`claude` works
    in your terminal);
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), logged in (`codex` works in your terminal);
  - an API key for DeepSeek or another OpenAI-compatible API, in an environment variable (see
    [Choosing the AI](#choosing-the-ai-claude-code-codex-deepseek-and-other-apis)).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DengZhiyuan-math/prism-local.git
cd prism-local
bin/prism-local examples/minimal          # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

To use it on your own project:

```sh
/path/to/prism-local/bin/prism-local /path/to/your/latex-project
# or, from inside the project:
/path/to/prism-local/bin/prism-local
```

Options:

- `--port 8765`: the port. `0` picks any free port.
- `--port-tries N`: if the port is taken, try the next N−1 ports.
- `--no-browser`: do not open a browser page.
- `--exit-when-idle`: exit about 10 seconds after the last editor or PDF page is closed.
- `--ready-file FILE`: once listening, write `{pid, port, url, root}` as JSON to FILE.

Without `--exit-when-idle`, stop the server with Ctrl-C.

## Home page

The Home page manages all your projects:

```sh
bin/prism-home                            # opens http://127.0.0.1:8790/
```

- **Project cards** show the first PDF page, the `\title`, the folder, when a source file last
  changed, the git branch and number of changed files, and a green **Open** badge while an
  editor runs for the project. Search with `/`, sort by recently opened, recently edited or name.
- **Open** starts prism-local for the project in the background (through the launcher, so it
  gets its stable port and stops after its last page closes) and opens the editor in a tab.
  A second click brings that tab back instead of opening another.
- **+ New project** (or `n`) creates a folder from a template (math paper with amsart and
  theorem environments, plain article, or empty), with `prism.json` and optionally a git
  repository, and opens it.
- **Add folder…** adds an existing LaTeX folder. **Browse…** opens a native folder dialog (tkinter).
- The **⋯** menu pins a project to the top, renames it in the list, shows it in Explorer/Finder,
  copies its path, or removes it from the list. Removing never touches the files.
- Every project you open with prism-local, by any route, is added to the list automatically.
- The ⌂ button in the editor opens the Home page, starting it if needed.

The list is stored in `projects.json` in the state directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\prism-local` on
Windows, `~/.local/state/prism-local` elsewhere, or `$PRISM_STATE_DIR`).

## One-click launcher (Windows)

`launcher/` creates a **Prism** shortcut in the Start menu and on the desktop:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\make-shortcut.ps1
```

Clicking it opens the Home page in a Chrome or Edge window of its own. From there you manage
your projects, and each project you open becomes a tab of that window with its editor. The
Home page stops about 10 seconds after you close it; open editors keep running until they
are closed too.

To skip the Home page for one project, make a shortcut that opens its editor directly:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\make-shortcut.ps1 -Project D:\path\to\paper
```

This creates **Prism · paper**. Clicking a project shortcut:

1. Opens another page if prism-local already runs for that project.
2. Otherwise starts prism-local in the background, with no console window, and opens the
   editor in a new Chrome or Edge window of its own. Chrome is used when it is your default
   browser. The pop-out PDF opens as a second tab in that window.
3. Stops the server about 10 seconds after you close the last Prism page (editor or pop-out PDF).
   Reloading a page does not stop it.

Details:

- **Processes.** The launcher exits as soon as the page is open. What stays behind is one
  `python.exe` (with its hidden `conhost.exe`) for the Home page and one for each open project.
  Nothing else waits in the background.
- **How a closed page is noticed.** Every page keeps a connection (an event stream) open to its
  server. When you close the page, the tab or the whole browser window, the connection drops and
  the server knows at once, even if the page had no time to say goodbye.
- **Stable port.** Each project always gets the same port, between 8800 and 9799, so the browser
  keeps its open tabs and chat per project. If the port is taken, the next free one is used.
- **Logs.** Server output goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\prism-local\logs\<project>-<hash>.log`. The
  previous run is kept as `.log.1`. If the server cannot start, a dialog shows the end of the log.
- **Running work.** A build or a Claude turn that is still running when the last page closes is
  allowed to finish, for at most 10 minutes, before the server exits.
- **Fallback.** Pages also send heartbeats. In the rare case that the event stream cannot be
  opened, a page that stops sending heartbeats counts as closed after 2 minutes.
- **Sleep.** After the computer wakes up, pages without an open stream get a fresh 2 minutes
  to check in.
- **Server gone.** If the server stopped while a page was still open, for example because the
  browser discarded a background tab, the page says so. Click the shortcut again and the page
  reconnects by itself.
- **Environment.** The shortcut runs in your normal user environment, so `tectonic`, `latexmk`,
  `git` and `claude` must be on your user `PATH`.
- **Browser modes.** `-Browser` picks how the editor opens:
  - `window`, the default: a new Chrome or Edge window with a tab strip, holding only Prism.
  - `app`: an app window without tabs or address bar. The pop-out PDF then gets its own app
    window, which suits a second monitor.
  - `default`: a tab in your default browser's current window. With Firefox as the default
    browser, every mode behaves like this.
- Other options of `make-shortcut.ps1`: `-Name`, `-NoDesktop`, and `-Folder` to put the
  shortcut somewhere else. To remove a shortcut, delete the `.lnk` file.

The launcher can also be run directly, on any platform:

```sh
python launcher/prism_launcher.pyw /path/to/paper [--browser window|app|default|none] [--port N]
python launcher/prism_launcher.pyw --home         # the Home page
```

`launcher/make_icon.py` redraws `launcher/prism.ico`.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ⌘S / Ctrl-S | Save now (edits are saved automatically anyway) |
| ⌘↵ / Ctrl-Enter | Save all and compile |
| ⌘J / Ctrl-J | Show the cursor line in the PDF |
| double-click in PDF | Jump to the source line |
| ⌘L / Ctrl-L | Ask Claude about the selection |
| ⌘/ / Ctrl-/ | Toggle `%` comments |
| ⌘B / Ctrl-B | Show/hide the file sidebar |
| Ctrl-Space | Completion |

## Build modes

The mode picker next to **Compile** offers:

- **Draft**: keeps going after TeX errors, so you still get a PDF while you write. Errors are
  still reported in red. Tectonic uses `-Z continue-on-errors`; latexmk uses `-f`.
- **Strict**: stops at the first error.
- **Check**: only appears if you configure it, for example as a project script that runs extra lint checks.

## Configuration: `prism.json` (optional)

Place `prism.json` in the project root. Every key is optional:

```json
{
  "main": "main.tex",
  "outdir": "build",
  "build": {
    "draft":  ["tectonic", "-o", "{outdir}", "--keep-logs", "--synctex", "-Z", "continue-on-errors", "{main}"],
    "strict": "scripts/build.sh",
    "check":  "scripts/check.sh"
  },
  "files":   ["main.tex", "chapters/**/*.tex", "*.bib"],
  "exclude": ["drafts/old/**"]
}
```

- `main`: the root document. Default: `main.tex`, otherwise the first top-level `.tex` file
  containing `\documentclass`.
- `outdir`: where the build writes `<main>.pdf`, `.log` and `.synctex.gz`. Default: `build`.
- `build`: commands for the `draft`, `strict` and `check` modes. Each is either an argv list or a
  shell string (run with `bash -c`). `{main}` and `{outdir}` are substituted. The build must
  produce SyncTeX data (`--synctex` for Tectonic, `-synctex=1` for latexmk/pdflatex).
- `files`: globs for the file tree. By default every `.tex/.bib/.md/.sty/.cls/.txt` file is listed,
  skipping hidden directories, `outdir` and `node_modules`.
- `exclude`: globs to hide from the file tree.

## The agent panel

This section describes the panel with Claude Code, the default. The next section covers the
other providers and what differs for them.

Each message runs Claude Code headlessly in your project:

```
claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages \
       --permission-mode <acceptEdits|plan> [--resume <session>] [--model <m>] [--effort <e>] \
       --append-system-prompt <…>
```

**Slash commands.** Type `/` in the message box to see every command and skill, with completion
(↑↓ to choose, Tab or ↵ to take one).

- The panel itself handles the commands that only exist in Claude Code's interactive terminal:
  - `/model [name]` shows or sets the model for the next messages (`/model default` to reset).
  - `/effort [level]` does the same for the effort level (`low` … `max`).
  - `/skills` lists the skills Claude Code can use in this project. Click one to use it.
  - `/provider [name]` shows the providers or switches to one (same as the menu in the panel).
  - `/mode edit|ask`, `/clear` (or `/new`), and `/help`.
- Everything else goes to Claude Code as the first thing in the prompt, where it looks for a
  command: skills such as `/code-review`, built-ins that work headlessly such as `/compact`
  and `/context`, and your project's own commands.
- A skill gets the editor context after the command, so it knows what "this" refers to.
  Built-in commands get none.
- Commands that need Claude Code's terminal (for example `/doctor`) are not offered here.

**@-mentions decide what Claude may change.** Type `@` to pick a project file, or the text
selected in the editor (also: select text and press ⌘L). A selection becomes a mention like
`@sections/intro.tex:12-18`, and its text is sent along.

- **With @-mentions**, Claude may change only the mentioned files. This is enforced, not just
  asked: the turn runs in Claude Code's default permission mode with `Edit`/`Write` allowed
  for those files only, so any other write is refused. For a line range, Claude is asked to
  keep to those lines.
- **Without @-mentions**, Claude may change any file in the project and create new ones.
- The line above the message box shows the scope before you send. The card at the end of a
  turn reports blocked edits, and any change outside the mentioned files (for example made
  by an allowed shell command), which **Undo this turn** reverts.
- Each message states its own scope, so a limit from an earlier message does not carry over.

Consequences:

- Claude reads your project's `CLAUDE.md`, skills and `.claude/settings.json`, exactly as it
  would in a terminal. Put writing conventions or rules for the paper in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Edit** mode (`acceptEdits`) may change files. Nothing can be approved interactively, so
  shell commands are limited to the `permissions.allow` list in `.claude/settings.json`, and
  anything else is refused. The card at the end of a turn names any refused tools.
- **Ask** mode (`plan`) is read-only.
- Nothing from the editor is sent unless you @-mention it.
- The conversation continues across messages until you press **New chat**.
- After each turn, a card lists the changed files with diffs and offers **Undo this turn**.
  - Undo restores a file only if nobody edited it since that turn.
  - Undo history lives in server memory, so it is lost when the server restarts.
  - For durable history, use git.
- **Cost**: each message is a full Claude Code run, billed to your Claude plan or API account
  like any other Claude Code usage.
- **Usage limits**: the bars show the 5-hour and 7-day utilization that Claude Code reports.
  - They update after each message.
  - **↻** refreshes them with a tiny Haiku call (about $0.001).
  - Usage from other sessions shows up at the next update.
- The panel finds the CLI on `PATH`. Set `CLAUDE_BIN=/path/to/claude` to override. Start
  prism-local from the same environment you use for `claude`, including any `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Choosing the AI: Claude Code, Codex, DeepSeek and other APIs

The menu at the top of the panel (or `/provider <name>`) picks who runs the agent. Each
provider keeps its own conversation, model and effort, so you can switch back and forth.
Providers that are not set up are greyed out; hover one to see what it needs.

| Provider | Kind | Set up with |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | Claude Code CLI | `claude` on `PATH`, or `CLAUDE_BIN` |
| `codex` | Codex CLI | `codex` on `PATH`, or `CODEX_BIN`; `codex login` |
| `deepseek` | API | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | API | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | API | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `qwen` | API (DashScope) | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| `moonshot` | API (Kimi) | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `ollama` | API, local | Ollama running on `127.0.0.1:11434`; no key |

API keys are read from environment variables only, never from a file in your project. On
Windows, set one for your user once and restart prism-local:

```powershell
setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

**Codex CLI.** Each message runs `codex exec --json` in the project, with the sandbox set to
`workspace-write` in Edit mode and `read-only` in Ask mode, and `resume` to continue the
conversation. Codex reads your `AGENTS.md`. `/effort` sets `model_reasoning_effort`
(`minimal` … `xhigh`). Codex cannot be limited to single files, so with @-mentions prism-local
**undoes any change it made outside the mentioned files** when the turn ends, and says so.

**API providers (DeepSeek and others).** There is no agent CLI, so prism-local runs the agent
loop itself over the OpenAI chat-completions API with function calling. The model gets five
tools: `list_files`, `read_file` and `search`, plus `write_file` and `edit_file` in Edit mode,
only for files the turn may change. It cannot run shell commands or compile. Your
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is added to its instructions. The model must support function
calling (DeepSeek's `deepseek-chat` does). The conversation lives in server memory and ends
when the server stops. The card at the end of a turn shows the tokens used.

**Your own providers and defaults** go in `~/.prism-local/agents.json` (or the file named by
`PRISM_AGENTS`). Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works:

```json
{
  "default": "deepseek",
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": { "default_model": "deepseek-reasoner" },
    "codex": { "bin": "C:/Users/me/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex.cmd" },
    "ollama": { "enabled": false },
    "my-vllm": {
      "type": "openai",
      "label": "vLLM on the GPU box",
      "base_url": "http://gpu-box:8000/v1",
      "api_key_env": "MY_VLLM_KEY",
      "models": ["qwen3-32b"]
    }
  }
}
```

- An entry with the name of a built-in provider changes only the fields it gives.
- Fields: `type` (`claude`, `codex` or `openai`), `label`, `bin` (CLIs), `base_url`,
  `api_key_env` (omit it for a server that needs no key), `models` (suggestions for `/model`;
  the first is the default), `default_model`, `efforts` (for APIs that take
  `reasoning_effort`), `headers`, `max_steps` (tool rounds per message, default 40),
  `timeout` (seconds), `enabled`.
- `PRISM_AGENT=<name>` picks the default provider for one run.

**Adding another kind of backend** (another agent CLI, or an API that is not OpenAI-compatible):
subclass `Backend` in `prism_local/backends.py`, or `CliBackend` for a CLI that prints JSON
lines, and register it in `load_backends`. The docstring of `backends.py` lists the events the
panel understands. The agent manager takes care of scopes, diffs and undo for every backend.

## Security model

prism-local is meant for a single user on their own machine.

- It binds to `127.0.0.1` only and rejects requests whose `Host` header is not `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
- Every state-changing request needs the header `X-Prism-Local: 1`. Browsers send a custom
  header cross-origin only after a CORS preflight, and the server never answers preflights, so
  other websites cannot drive the server.
- The one exception is the goodbye a closing page sends with `navigator.sendBeacon`, which
  cannot set headers. It must come from the same origin, and it only removes a page id that
  has sent a heartbeat. The presence stream is a GET, and it is refused unless it comes from
  the same origin, so other sites cannot keep the server running.
- It reads and writes only text source files inside the project directory. Hidden directories
  and the build directory are excluded.
- Anyone who can reach the port can run your build commands and the agent. Do not expose
  the port to a network: no port forwarding, no `0.0.0.0`.
- With an API provider, the files the model reads and your messages are sent to that
  provider's `base_url`. The key stays in the server's environment and never reaches the page.

## Limitations

- SyncTeX lookup is a compact reimplementation, not the `synctex` library. It is accurate to the
  line for ordinary text and math. Inside complex constructs (tables, TikZ, floats) it can land a few lines off.
- The Tectonic build path is the one tested most. The latexmk defaults use standard flags
  (`-pdf -synctex=1 -file-line-error`).
- No collaborative editing, and no file creation, rename or delete inside the editor. Use your
  file manager, git or Claude for those. (The Home page can create new projects.)
